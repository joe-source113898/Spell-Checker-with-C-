# Word Spell Checker CLI

A simple command-line interface (CLI) application for checking the spelling of words using a dictionary. This application is built in C++ and provides basic suggestions for misspelled words by modifying each letter in the input word.

## Features

- Loads a dictionary from a text file.
- Checks if a given word is correctly spelled.
- Suggests similar words by changing one letter at a time.
- Fast lookups using an unordered set for the dictionary.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)
- A text file containing a list of valid words (one per line) named `dictionary.txt`.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/word-spell-checker-cli.git
   cd word-spell-checker-cli

2. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
   g++ spell_checker.cpp -o spell_checker

3. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   ./spell_checker

## Code structure
- spell_checker.cpp: Main program file containing the logic for loading the dictionary, checking spelling, and generating suggestions.
- dictionary.txt: A text file containing valid words (one word per line). This file is required for the spell checker to work.

# How it works
- Dictionary loading: The program loads all words from dictionary.txt into an unordered_set for quick lookups.
- Spelling check: The program checks if the input word is present in the dictionary.
- Suggestion generation: If the word is not found, the program suggests alternative words by replacing each letter with every letter in the alphabet and checking if the result is in the dictionary.

## Example dictionary file
Make sure to include a dictionary.txt file in the same directory as spell_checker.cpp. Hereâ€™s an example content:
```bash
cat
cot
cut
bat
rat
...

## Potential improvements
- Implement more advanced suggestion algorithms (e.g., Levenshtein distance).
- Support additional operations like adding, removing, or transposing letters.
- Make the dictionary file path configurable from the command line.
